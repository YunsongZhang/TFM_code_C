In this code, I have done the following attempt

I let the bending modulus to be 0.01 at first and let the network relax
Then I applied PSO to predict the displacements, assuing bending modulus to be 0.05
Then I adiabatically adjust the bending modulus little by little from 0.05 to 0.01

I will see what will happen


In later versions of this code, I have modified the implementation of PSO algorithm.

The optimization will start afresh when it gets stuck.Also, a downhill simplex algorithm is followed!
